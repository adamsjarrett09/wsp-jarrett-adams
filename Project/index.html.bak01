        		<h2>Big State Drugs History</h2>
        			<p>Historically, Big State Drugs is located on what was originally developed by Charles Stovall for his Banner Mercantile store, a large frame building at the time. Circa 1914 C.T. Lucas, a former employee, turned renter, turned owner, moved the frame store located at the corner of First and Main. He built the permanent brick building in its place where Big State currently resides. Mr. Lucas also used the vacant land just south of the building as a poultry farm. He owned and operated the Banner Merchantile until the early 1930's.</p>
