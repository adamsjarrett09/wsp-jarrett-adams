    	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
    	
    	<p>The intent for bigstatedrugs.com is to inform people in the Irving, TX area that they are a small, family owned 
    	pharmacy with a soda fountain and a grill. Big State Drugs also offers gifts, medical equipment and other items in 
    	their all-in-one shop. The goals of the site are being stated well enough to know what the business is about, but 
    	the interface and the design of the site lacks the vision of the goals stated, therefore, it creates a bad user experience. 
    	Since the site looks "dirty", no one would want to eat or get any of their medical needs from this place.</p>
    	
    	<p>The intent I will try to convey through the re-design of the site is a friendly, down-home family experience 
    	through the visual design of the site. The information on the site will also be concise through a very simple 
    	user interface.</p><br>

    	<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    	
    	<p>After researching the information found on Alexia.com for Big State Drugs, there really isn't any competitors for the
    	website because Big State Drugs has a unique market. I explored the possibility of larger pharmacy chains like CVS and 
    	Walgrens, but Big State Drugs only has one location. Also, there isn't any other place that serves as a pharmacy and a
    	restaurant. This creates a unique challenge because now I have the task of not only creating a visual interface that best 
    	compliments the intent of the site, but also to best compliment the unique market of a pharmacy/restaurant.</p><br>

    	<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
    	
    	<p>The target audience fo Big State Drugs is anyone who is in need of any medical needs they may have or anyone who wants to
    	dine on American cuisine such as burgers, fries, etc. Since it's safe to assume that we as human beings need some sort of 
    	medicine or medical aid in our lives, there's no age demographic that applies. The income demographic would range from the 
    	lower to lower-middle class income brackets(anywhere from $10,000/year to $40,000/year).</p><br>

    	<h2>User Cases</h2>
    	
    	<p id="user_info">Kathy Smith - 72 Years Old - No Occupation(Medical constraints) - Not Married(Widowed)</p>
    	<p>Kathy is a senior citizen that has some medical needs. She has Arthritis in her left hand and right knee. Kathy was raised 
    	in a small city environment, so she does not like to deal with big chains and conglomerates. She feels more comfortable 
    	getting the things she needs from people she has known and trusted for many years.</p>
    	
    	<p id="user_info">Jake Bennet< - 16 Years Old - No Occupation(Student) - Not Married</p>
    	<p>Jake is a high school student in Irving, TX. Most times after school, the kids from the nearby high school go to hang out, 
    	and the most attractive spot would be a restaurant. Jake gets $50 in allowance from his parents every week, and usually 
    	spends $20 of purchasing food outside of his residence.</p>
